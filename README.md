## 📌 Problem Statement
  
**Problem Statement 1: Weave AI magic with Groq**
- Distraction from social media and other apps is a massive productivity killer,

## 🎯 Objective

- and receive timely motivational prompts generated by AI (via Groq). 
- It empowers users to build healthy focus habits using smart streaks, progress charts, and customizable focus goals.

Target Audience:

- Remote workers
- Anyone struggling with app-based distractions
